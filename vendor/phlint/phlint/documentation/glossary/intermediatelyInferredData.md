Glossary: Intermediately Inferred Data
======================================

In order to do deep semantic analysis one needs to analyze code not only as independent pieces but
rather as pieces of a puzzle and relations between those pieces where sometimes relations can be
more important than pieces themselves.

In order to handle complex relations an intermediate data is stored and passed on in between inferences
to give specific code a context in further analysis.
